# User stories

User stories are fundamental user needs. Usually they represent a large chunk of features. That's why a user story is often broken down into smaller user stories or requirement.

This document describes main high-level user stories.

## Users

- Client
- Support

## As a Client I want to...

### Archive

...archive my photos and videos reliably, durably, cost-effective, securely as originals for long-term, because I want to have a 100% reliable backup.

### UX

...have UX with minimal steps to complete archival, because I want to upload photos without tutorials and with minimal steps required.

### Feedback

...be notified about the state of the system, because I want to understand that my photos and videos are 100% uploaded.

### Pay as you go

...have pay-as-you-go pricing, because I don't want to pay for unused storage.

### Pricing transparency

...be communicated transparently about pricing, because I want to know how&why I am charged exactly that amount of money.

### Auto sort
...my photos and videos automatically sorted in folders, because it's hard and time consuming to sort by hand.

### 3-2-1

...have a software that can perform 3-2-1 backup automatically. (e.g. local drive, hard drive, cloud).

### Sync from a device

...set a folder on my PC to automatically sync with cloud, because I want to be sure that every photo is backed up in cloud.

### Original folder structure

...keep my existing folder structure, because I want to migrate without losing any structure.

### Share

...share my account with other family members, because I want all family photos to be in one place and so other family members could have access to photos.

### Recover

...have a solid account recovery process, because I want to restore my account even if I lost my email & password.
